# Word Scenes
Want to expand your vocabulary? Drawing a scene is a tried a true way to enhance memory! It's derived from the Link Memory Method.

Let's say you want to build your French vocabulary and you are a native English speaker. The app will fetch two things: 
1. A random French word with English translation 
2. A French sentence using that word along with English translation. 

The point is to draw a scene related to that word or sentence then submit it. 
Every once in a while, the app will throw the illustration back to you asking what word was associated with it.
